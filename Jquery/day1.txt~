AJAX provides you with the ability to: Communicate with your server Pass information back and forth, from the clients browser to the server Update your web page content, without reloading the webpage 

This is the main way people use AJAX:

They write JavaScript code that is triggered to perform some action when a certain event occurs on the website.
When that event is triggered, JavaScript is used to get data from the server, using an object called XMLHttpRequest. (More on this very soon)
The new information is inserted into your web page, with out a page reload. This is called Asynchronous Data Retrieval.
The only negative is that you can only pass XML or Regular Text, between the JavaScript Code and the server.
In addition you can use JavaScript code to call PHP code to receive information from a Database.
On the fly CSS changes through JavaScript code, is also referred to as an AJAX technique.
Now you know the basics. So it’s time to learn, How to AJAX, like a pro!
